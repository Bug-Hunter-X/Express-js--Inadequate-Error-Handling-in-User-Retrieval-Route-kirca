# Express.js - Inadequate Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling. The `bug.js` file shows an Express route that lacks comprehensive error handling, particularly for database operations and unexpected input.  The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to improve the error handling to make the application more robust and reliable.

## Bug Description

The provided code retrieves user data based on a provided ID.  However, it lacks proper error handling for scenarios such as:

* The user not being found in the database.
* Errors during database interaction (e.g., database connection issues).
* Invalid input (e.g., non-numeric user IDs).

This lack of error handling can lead to unexpected application crashes or the exposure of internal errors to the client.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates a better approach. It includes try-catch blocks to handle database errors gracefully. Additionally, it utilizes more specific HTTP status codes to communicate errors to the client, providing more informative responses.  A centralized error handler is also implemented for consistency.
